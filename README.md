## Design phase:

Start at: 11:17
End at: 11:53

## Assumption:

"Create a script that can read data sequentially"

Each set of file is independent of the previous one.

## Development:

Total time: 3.5 - 4 h

## Outlier strategy:
I am using a z-score with lower than 4 standard deviations so we get to remove 4 points

## Pending:

UnitTest
